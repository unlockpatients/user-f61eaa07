        { question: "Is a pediatric school physical the same as a well-child visit?", answer: "A school physical meets the requirements for school entry, but a comprehensive well-child visit also covers developmental, behavioral, and other health topics in more detail. We can often complete school forms during a scheduled well-child visit." },
        { question: "What forms do I need to bring for a school physical?", answer: "Please bring the specific health form provided by your child's school. If you don't have one, we have the standard Florida state forms available at our office." },
        { question: "How long is a school physical valid?", answer: "School physicals in Florida are valid for 365 days. Your school district will require an updated form for specific grades or upon first entry into the district." }
