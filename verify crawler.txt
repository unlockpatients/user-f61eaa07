test: curl -I "https://mydomain.com/redirect?adgroupid=123"

If everything is configured correctly, the response will look something like this:

HTTP/2 302 
location: https://mydomain.com/landing-newborns
cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate
server: Vercel


Meaning:

HTTP/2 302 ‚Üí temporary server-side redirect (perfect for Google Ads)

location: header ‚Üí points directly to your final landing page

server: Vercel ‚Üí confirms it‚Äôs handled at the edge before any HTML is rendered

That‚Äôs exactly how Google AdsBot wants it.


---
‚ö†Ô∏è If You See Something Like:
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: text/html


or

<meta http-equiv="refresh" ...>


That means the redirect is happening client-side (e.g., via JavaScript or meta refresh), which Google AdsBot will not follow ‚Äî and that would hurt your landing page experience.

üß† Pro Tip ‚Äî Simulate Google‚Äôs Crawler

You can even spoof the AdsBot user agent to double-check how Google sees it:

curl -I -A "AdsBot-Google" "https://mydomain.com/redirect?adgroupid=123"
curl -I -A "AdsBot-Google" "https://book.wonderkidzpediatrics.com/pediatrician-near-me"

If the headers are the same (shows HTTP 302 and a valid Location:), then you‚Äôre golden ‚Äî AdsBot will successfully follow it and evaluate the final page normally.
